# Week 5 Lab Report: Using the Grep Command in 3 Different Ways
For this lab report, I will be using the `grep` command with 3 different variations. Assume all commands are within the `./technical` directory.

## -r
```
grep -r "oxi"

```
When you do not specify the directory, the `-r` command will recursively look through the current directory and all sub-directories for the substring you want to search for.
```
grep -r "oxi" biomed/*

Once you specify a directory, the computer recursively searches for files within the directory and any sub-directories it has for the search term. It's useful if you want to perform a general search of all files within a directory without having to go to each subdirectory every time.

```
grep -r "oxi" government

```
You do not need to use the `/` to specify a path either, as long as you know the directory you are trying to search, using the `-r` variant of `grep` will allow you to search for a substring within a directory and its sub-directories. The substring you are looking for will be highlighted as well, allowing you to see where it was found more easily.
## -n
The `-n` variant of the `grep` command allows you to find the specific line where the search term is found in each file.
```
grep -n "oxide" biomed/*
.
.
.
biomed/rr167.txt:285:          was dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which

biomed/rr74.txt:146:          Hematocrit and nitric oxide metabolite
biomed/rr74.txt:223:          Nitric oxide metabolites
biomed/rr74.txt:418:        eNOS = endothelial nitric oxide synthase; iNOS =
biomed/rr74.txt:419:        inducible nitric oxide synthase; nNOS = neuronal nitric
biomed/rr74.txt:420:        oxide synthase; NO = nitric oxide; NOS = nitric oxide
```
You can quickly find the exact line where the substring was found in each file. To do this, you need to specify the directory you are searching in so that you are not stuck in the terminal for a long time. 
```
grep -n "oxi" government/*
grep: government/About_LSC: Is a directory
grep: government/Alcohol_Problems: Is a directory
grep: government/Env_Prot_Agen: Is a directory
grep: government/Gen_Account_Office: Is a directory
grep: government/Media: Is a directory
grep: government/Post_Rate_Comm: Is a directory
```
You also need to use this command in a directory where there are files since this command cannot search through the current directory and sub-directories recursively.
```
grep -n "oxi" government/About_LSC/*
government/About_LSC/Comments_on_semiannual.txt:335:during the March ABA/NLADA Equal Justice Conference. Approximately

```
Here is where the `-n` command works when you specify the directory, a sub-directory, and a file path. It will be useful to find the specific line where a file contains the substring so that you can access the file and jump to that line right away.
## -c
The `-c` variant of the `grep` command counts how many times the specified search term pops up in every file, even if it does not show up at all.
```
grep -c "oxide" biomed/*
.
.
.

Like the `-n` variant, you need to specify the directory, any potential sub-directories, and the file path so that the terminal is not stuck for a long time. You can use this as an anti-plagiarism tool to see whether an existing idea was taken and used in some kind of report.
```
grep -c "nitric oxide" biomed/*

.

```
The `-c` variant will still show files that do not contain the substring at all. It can be useful to know what files don't have the search term so that you can avoid looking through those files, but at the same time it will be annoying to sift through them when you have hundreds of files that do not contain the substring.
```
grep -c "oxi" plos/*
.
.
.
plos/journal.pbio.0020348.txt:18
plos/journal.pbio.0020350.txt:1
plos/journal.pbio.0020353.txt:1
plos/journal.pbio.0020354.txt:1
plos/journal.pbio.0020394.txt:0
plos/journal.pbio.0020400.txt:64
plos/journal.pbio.0020401.txt:20
.
.
.
```
Searching in the `plos` directory, there is a file that has a lot of instances of the substring, so the `-c` variant is helpful for trying to find files that uses the search term many times.
